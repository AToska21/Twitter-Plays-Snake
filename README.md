## Features
#### Special modes
Special snake modes change up the gameplay and have a 25% chance of activating after each move.
-  ``游땓游릵游릵游릮`` Devil snake moves in the opposite direction of the chosen move. 
-  ``游뱍游릴游릴游릭`` Glutted snake dies when eating an apple.
-  ``游땨游린游린游댮`` Charged snake continues to move until reaching an obstacle.

Special fruit change up the gameplay and can spawn after earning a point.
- ``游꼞游꼞`` Green apples spawn in doubles, teleporting the snake to its pair when collected.

#### Serialization
Games are loaded and saved between program runs if ``SAVEPATH`` is specified in ``Bot.java``.
#### Debug mode
Setting ``DEBUG`` to ``true`` in ``Bot.java`` allows you to play the game solo with console commands for debugging purposes.
